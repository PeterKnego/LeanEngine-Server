What is LeanEngine
------------------

LeanEngine is an open source project aiming make the development of cloud-enabled mobile applications really simple, fast and fun. It lets you focus on developing your mobile app while it handles all the boring and complicated stuff. Stuff like:

* logins (Facebook, Google, Twitter, OpenID)
* syncing data (store and retrieve data to and from cloud)
* security
* push over multiple platforms (coming soon)

All this you can achieve with using LeanEngine libraries and a few lines of code on your clients. LeanEngine server runs on Google App Engine.
